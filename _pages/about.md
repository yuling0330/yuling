Hi, my name is Yuling Gu. Recently I just finished my data science intern from Zebra Technology. During this internship, I participated in the Forklift Movement project that help improve the workflow of the warehouse by Analyzed current pallet sensor detection accuracy. At the end of the program, I presented findings and contributions to CTO-Solution team. 

Before this program I was working as a pricing actuary in an insurance consulting company. I handled a client in insurance, with a pricing project within the home appliances market dealing in different extended warranty products.

Part of my work involves brainstorming with the client on communication strategies involving the extended warranties and how best to market different products to different client groups. Despite the lack of sufficient data sometimes, I was able to combine different sources of information, such as the operating risk from sales and also data from the claims side of the business, into my calculations. 

In the mean time, I like to learn anything to the edge technology. Currently I am learning Coppelia with my friends and try to achieve robot locolization, path planning.
