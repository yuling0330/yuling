### Project Summary

**Problem Statement**:

Yelp is a business directory service and crowd-sourced review forum, as well as the online reservation service Yelp Reservations. The company also trains small businesses in how to respond to reviews, hosts social events for reviewers, and provides data about businesses, including health inspection scores.

**Objective**:
The goal of our project is to predict stars and type of reviews that restaurants received based on the overall data. On the other hand, we also worked on recommending restaurants to users based on stars and reviews received.
