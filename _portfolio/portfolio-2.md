### Project Summary

**Problem Statement**:

Diabetic retinopathy  is the most common cause of vision impairment and blindness. It is caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).
From 2010 to 2050, the number of diabetic retinopathy is expected to nearly double, from 7.7m to 14.6m in the US.

**Objective**:

The purpose of this project is to create model that couldcorrectly classify the five stages of the disease, given the images of different patients.

  - 0 - No DR
  - 1 - Mild
  - 2 - Moderate
  - 3 - Severe
  - 4 - Proliferative DR
